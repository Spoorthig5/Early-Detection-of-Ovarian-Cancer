# Early-Detection-of-Ovarian-Cancer
Early detection of ovarian cancer is an important challenge in the healthcare field, since it is diagnosed mostly at later stages when the disease is less likely to be cured, and options for treatment are very limited and survival rates reduced significantly. Early detection through conventional methods, including routine pelvic examination and imaging techniques, is also inadequate. This aims to create an innovative solution for the early detection of ovarian cancer using advanced machine learning techniques. By combining medical imaging, genetic data sets, and tumor biomarkers, the project aims to classify subtle signs of ovarian cancer as early as possible in their development when treatment might be most effective.

## Project Description
This is a data preprocessing methodology that ensures data quality and accuracy, followed by the building and assessment of machine learning models with Random Forests, Decision Trees, and Deep Learning techniques. Motivated by the previous work, this project also employs Explainable AI in generating explainable predictions to further be used in clinical applications.
In that regard, by identifying subtle early-stage indicators of ovarian cancer, this project could enhance diagnostic accuracy, support clinical decision-making, and improve the outcomes of treatment.
